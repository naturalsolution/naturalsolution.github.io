## Products
Natural Solutions is here to help you grow things better. Our products will help you produce higher quality yields both more effectively and more efficiently. Below are products designed to do just that:

Soil EP - Provides beneficial soil microbes that release tied up nutrients in the soil and produce deeper, thicker and increased number of roots for the plant.

Ag 66 - Provides the essential micronutrients and trace elements to depleted soil that all plants must have to thrive and produce marketable/profitable crops.

Soil FX - Provides a proprietary blend of microbes and micronutrients that develops healthier roots with the right vitamins and minerals while releasing the tied up nutrients in the soil.

Weatoil - Weatoil is a microbial solution for bioremediation applications. Bioremediation allows natural processes to clean up harmful chemicals in the environment. Microbes that live in soil and groundwater digest certain harmful chemicals, such as those found in gasoline and oil spills. When microbes completely digest these chemicals, they convert them into water and harmless gases such as carbon dioxide.

Fly Away Solution - FAS is a microbial solution for mosquito, knat, and fly control. FAS microbes eat the organic matter the make up the wings, disrupting the larvae cycle and aiding in over all control of these pests.
